# Matrix.utils

A simple copy of the Matrix.utils version 0.9.8 from https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/Matrix.utils/.

The original R package was removed from cran and this was the easiest way to fix the problem.

I do not plann to fix any problems in this package. So if you need the Matrix.utils and this version does not help you you are on your own. Unless I also need this functionality ;-)
